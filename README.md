# Unity-PostPIE-SunShafts

Description:
------------ 


* Unity - "PostPIE" -> "Post Processing Image Effects" - Sun Shafts

This is simply the old "Sun Shafts Image Effects" from Unity "Standard Assets" simply edited to use with "Post Processing V2".


Dependencies:
-------------


* Project Dependency: Post Processing V2


Project Reason Note: 
--------------------


The reason for this project was very simple, I found recently that an asset I had purchased awhile back and liked and had planned to use in a project was since then removed from the asset store due to depreciation and upon looking at the asset package I noticed the reason was most likely that the dependency on the old standard assets package as the asset was using sun shafts and as such since standard assets package was long gone and prior to that also the image effects was also removed from  the long gone standard assets and also that long ago post processing became post-processing v2, I contacted the particular asset author of the depreciated asset using such and mentioned this upon noticing the asset was removed from the asset store due to depreciation of the aforementioned and hoped the author would fix those issues so that the asset would be available again, alas several months went by and this task was not done as far as I could see and rather than bugging the asset author I decided that the only option now was to do some minor edits to included sun shafts related files to get the depreciated asset I was desiring to use back on track, and that is the reason for this project. Simple enough right?! Anyhoo, hopefully that all makes sense.
